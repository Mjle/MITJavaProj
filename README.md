Learning Java from MIT OpenCourseware 6.092

## Synopsis

This course is still in progress. I am using it to refresh my java knowledge and show presentable java programs.

## Installation

For MAC OS X, I recommend using [ECLIPSE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) as this is what I was taught to use.

## Tests

Simply open any of the projects in Eclipse and run the program.
